# voice-recorder-app
A voice recorder I developed to practice my Electron skills.

The app is finished. Follow the steps below in order to use it.

- Download the code by clicking on the green button "<> Code"

- Click "Download ZIP"

- Decompress the file

- Open the folder using VSCode

- Open the terminal and type "npm run dist" and it will create a folder inside the folder which you decompressed

- Inside this folder, to run the app, you should open the "dist" folder normally, as if you were to open any other folder

- You will see a file named "Recorder-1.0.0.AppImage". Double click it and the app will open

- Make sure to set where you want to audio files to be saved by checking the "Preferences" menu


Another way to use the app is to simply download the zipped folder through the link below. This way, it will not be necessary to have the VSCode installed on your computer. You simply decompress it and run the app by clicking twice the "Recorder-1.0.0.AppImage" file.

SNAPCRAFT

Another option is to install using the Snap package manager. Although some people might not like Snap, and prefer AppImage or Flatpak to it, it is still very used by the community.

You might install using the link below:

Or through the command line. You need to have the Snap package manager installed on your linux distribution before running the command.

The command:

$ sudo snap install renanmakotos-recorder
